1. Create MySQL Database Schema:

Open your preferred MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command line).
Execute SQL commands to create the database schema. For example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;


2. Update Configuration in Resources Folder:

Navigate to the resources folder in your project directory.
Look for a configuration file that contains database connection details. 

**/webParent/WebBackEnd/src/main/resources/application.properties


You also can change the port 

local_port=750


database_name=your_database_name
root_username=your_username
password=your_password
Save the changes.
Note: Make sure to keep sensitive information like database credentials secure. Do not share them publicly.




After completing these steps, your web app should be configured to use the newly created MySQL database schema with the updated connection details. 



Run Maven clean and build the backend  your application to apply the changes.
